# Tetris_Game
Tetris is one of the most iconic and beloved puzzle games of all time. In this fast-paced game, players must manipulate a series of falling geometric shapes, known as "tetrominoes," to create and complete full horizontal lines on the game grid. As each line is completed, it disappears, and the remaining blocks shift down. The goal is to keep the grid clear for as long as possible without the tetrominoes stacking up to the top.

The game increases in speed as you progress, making it more challenging to place the falling pieces efficiently. With simple, yet addictive gameplay, Tetris combines strategy, quick thinking, and spatial awareness, making it a timeless game for all ages. Whether you're playing for a few minutes or hours, Tetris offers endless fun and the thrill of chasing a new high score.

Perfect for both casual players and competitive enthusiasts, Tetris has become a cornerstone of gaming culture since its creation in 1984.
